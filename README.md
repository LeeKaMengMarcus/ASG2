# Genshin Info

This project basically fetches an api off the website called https://api.genshin.dev/ and shows the names, icon and stats of characters, artifacts and weapons. The website also randomizes all of the characters and items, so that it can be used as a gacha luck test as well and it will not be sorted in any ways.
 
## Design Process

This website is made for those that wants to get information of the game called genshin impact. It consists of all the information about the up-to-date characters and items. players can use this website to gain a better game play by knowing what is good to build and what items should be built.

As a user, i would like to get more information that my characters and items that i currently have. By doing so, it makes me know about what is good and bad for my character, which is helpful as better builts on a character make it stronger in the game. Therefore, the website can help users to make their gameplay experiences better.

And this is the prototype of my website: (https://xd.adobe.com/view/5e3449ae-80d4-4bd0-b09d-427097dddb88-0b67/)

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

The navigation bar helps to go to different sections of the website, the Home page, the Artifact page, the Characters page, the Weapons page.
When navigaed to the Artifacts page, it shows all the artifacts that is currently available in the game. The items are randomized so they are not sorted.
When navigaed to the Characters page, it shows all the characters that is currently available in the game. The characters are randomized so they are not sorted.
When navigaed to the Weapons page, it shows all the weapons that is currently available in the game. The items are randomized so they are not sorted.
Another feature for my website is the "top" buttom located at the bottom right. It will only show up when scrolling down, or not at the top of the page. When it is clicked, it will go to the top of the page.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users to see all the artifacts that is currently available in the game when clicked on 'Artifacts' at the top of every page.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/xd.html)
    - The project uses **Adobe XD** to make frameworks.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Media Query:
    1. The webpage will just show the content of the the api with a scroll down page and a top button function.
    2. The background will still be the same just that it will only be a small portion of it.

2. Navigation Bar:
    1. all of it will navigate to the corresponding pages when clicked.
    2. information will show up when navigated to that page.

3. Top Button:
    1. in all pages, the top button located at the bottom right will make the website go to the top of the page when clicked
